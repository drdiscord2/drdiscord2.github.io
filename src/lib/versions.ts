            this patch introduces some improvements and fixes combined with other fan-made patches to enhance your gameplay experience:
            code updates:

            1. the moon event no longer makes the moon pink (credits to moonfix patch)
            2. moonglitch no longer makes your render distance low
            3. the moon event's phase is capped at a maximum of 2, preventing it from exceeding that limit. Previously, if it did that, it prevented the broken end from spawning.
            4. agressive mobs despawn event now only works when the moon event is active. Previously, they would disappear during moon phases 5 through 8 regardless, often resulting in event/entities overload
            5. questions in chat has been updated to be case-insensitive.
            6. error in the code where two events shared the same ID has been fixed, effectively adding a new event.
            7. the moon event now occurs more frequently. Earlier, triggering it required first encountering a rare random event (with odds of 1 in 55) and also having a specific moon phase. The latter condition has been removed.
            8. days no longer reset
            9. the broken end spawn conditions now only require the second phase of the moon event, making him more often. Previously, it also requires a specific texture of the moon from the atlas to be visible.
            10. sub anomalies now despawn more frequently
            11. random entity (missing texture dude) is now back. Previously in 1.9.3, if he tried to spawn in his true form, he just despawned instantly.
            12. flipped the broken moon's texture to hopefully make letters more readable
            13. fixed a bug that is left unpatched since 1.9 where glitchy/noisy siluet could not spawn because it tried to play a sound that is not present in the build
            14. null's username is now the same everywhere. Previously, in the chat it was written with a capital letter, but in tab menu it was written with a lowercase one for some reason
            15. err.themoon does not appear for no reason now
            16. nerfed a certain event that could basically //set 0 your entire buildings
            17. there were two structures that are fully complete but for some reason are left unused. There's also multiple copies of "carcas" structure in the code for whatever reason. This patch replaces these copies with the unused structures.
            18. probably something else. If you have any coding knowledge, you may compare the hashes with the original build to see the full list of changes I've made.
