## Setup

The events API lets you easily create your own events by inheriting from the
[BaseEvent](/javadoc/dev/wendigodrip/thebrokenscript/api/event/BaseEvent.html) class.

Events can only run server-side, so you don't have to worry about them accidentally triggering client-side.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Kotlin">
        ```kt title="MyEvent.kt"
        package com.example.mymod.events

        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.event.BaseEvent
        import net.minecraft.server.level.ServerLevel
        import net.minecraft.server.level.ServerPlayer
        import net.minecraft.world.phys.Vec3

        //              BaseEvent(weight: Int)
        class MyEvent : BaseEvent(1) {
            // level: The level the event was executed in.
            // player: The player the event was executed on.
            // pos: The position of the entity, where the event was executed.
            override fun execute(level: ServerLevel, player: ServerPlayer, pos: Vec3) {
                // Your code here...
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Java">
        ```java title="MyEvent.java"
        package com.example.mymod.events;

        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.event.BaseEvent;
        import net.minecraft.server.level.ServerLevel;
        import net.minecraft.server.level.ServerPlayer;
        import net.minecraft.world.phys.Vec3;

        public class MyEvent extends BaseEvent {
            public MyEvent() {
                super(/* weight = */ 1);
            }

            // level: The level the event was executed in.
            // player: The player the event was executed on.
            // pos: The position of the entity, where the event was executed.
            @Override
            public void execute(ServerLevel level, ServerPlayer player, Vec3 pos) {
                // Your code here...
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

There are a LOT of utilities in the base class, so I'd recommend taking a good look at the docs!

## Weights

The weight property, which you need to specify when calling the super constructor, determines how
often events are called.

All events have their own weights which determine how often an event is triggered. A higher number
will mean the event is more frequent. The weight must be an integer, meaning you can't use `0.25`
or something like that.

All current events in The Broken Script itself use the weight of `1`. This may change in the future.

<Aside type="note">
    If you're unsure what your weight should be, just make it `1`! It just means
    it has the same chance of being triggered randomly than any other.

## Registration

Don't forget to register the event:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Kotlin">
        ```kt title="MyMod.kt" ins={6,17}
        package com.example.mymod

        import net.neoforged.fml.common.Mod
        import thedarkcolour.kotlinforforge.neoforge.forge.MOD_BUS
        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.registry.ExtendedRegistrate
        import com.example.mymod.events.MyEvent

        @Mod(MyMod.MOD_ID)
        object MyMod {
            const val MOD_ID: String = "my_mod"
            val REGISTRAR = ExtendedRegistrate.create(MOD_ID)

            init {
                // Your code here...

                //              [   ID   ]  [Constructor]
                REGISTRAR.event("my_event", ::MyEvent).register()
                                                    // ^^^^^^^ Make sure you call .register(), or it won't register!
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Java">
        ```java title="MyMod.java" ins={7,18}
        package com.example.mymod;

        import net.neoforged.fml.ModContainer;
        import net.neoforged.fml.common.Mod;
        import net.neoforged.bus.api.IEventBus;
        import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.registry.ExtendedRegistrate;
        import com.example.mymod.events.MyEvent;

        @Mod(MyMod.MOD_ID)
        public class MyMod {
            public static final String MOD_ID = "my_mod";
            public static final ExtendedRegistrate<?> REGISTRAR = ExtendedRegistrate.Companion.create(MOD_ID);

            public MyMod(IEventBus bus, ModContainer mod) {
                // Your code here...

                //              [   ID   ]  [Constructor]
                REGISTRAR.event("my_event", MyEvent::new).register();
                                                        // ^^^^^^^ Make sure you call .register(), or it won't register!
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

After registering, you can test your event using the `/tbs dev event force [id]` command,
but make sure to enable cheats in the config first!

<Aside type="caution">
    Custom events won't be enabled by default in the config. This is a known
    issue and is being worked on for the next update. This is due to the way the
    current config system works.
