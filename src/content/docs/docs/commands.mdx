<Aside type="danger">
    The command framework is only available for people who write their mod in
    Kotlin! Due to the way it uses variadic arguments and many other features,
    it won't be possible to get all the utility out of it with Java!
</Aside>

The Broken Script features a fully-featured command framework that allows for
quick and easy registration of commands using a concise DSL.

Check out the [Javadoc](/javadoc/dev/wendigodrip/thebrokenscript/api/commands/package-summary.html)
for all the things it includes (I recommend starting at the `CommandDSL` class).

## Initial Setup

To start, you have to create the DSL wrapper inside the `RegisterCommandsEvent`:

```kt title="MyCommands.kt" {12}
package com.example.mymod.commands

import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.commands.CommandDSL
import net.neoforged.bus.api.SubscribeEvent
import net.neoforged.fml.common.EventBusSubscriber
import net.neoforged.neoforge.event.RegisterCommandsEvent

@EventBusSubscriber
object MyCommands {
    @SubscribeEvent
    fun register(event: RegisterCommandsEvent) {
        CommandDSL(event.dispatcher) {
            // Your code here...
        }
    }
}
```

## Adding Commands

To add commands, you just call `add()` with your syntax and arguments, and a block that handles the command.

```kt title="MyCommands.kt" ins={4-7,14-40}
package com.example.mymod.commands

// ...
import net.minecraft.commands.arguments.EntityArgument
import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.ext.EntityTypeExt.trySpawnOneThousand
import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.registry.TBSEntities
import net.minecraft.network.chat.Component

@EventBusSubscriber
object MyCommands {
    @SubscribeEvent
    fun register(event: RegisterCommandsEvent) {
        CommandDSL(event.dispatcher) {
            // Arguments are denoted with brackets ('[]'), and their names are inside.
            // The number of arguments should ALWAYS match the number of argument *types* provided.

            // This would be `/funny [players]`, so
            // `/funny @s` or `/funny SomePlayer` or even `/funny @a[tag=do_the_funny]` would work.
            add("funny [players]", EntityArgument.players()) {
                // Get the argument
                val players = EntityArgument.getPlayers(it, "players")

                // Go through every player the selector ('players') matched
                for (player in players) {
                    // Spawn 1000 circuits at the player's location.
                    // `trySpawnOneThousand` is an extension function from TBS's `EntityTypeExt` object.
                    TBSEntities.CIRCUIT.get().trySpawnOneThousand(player.level(), player.position())
                }

                // 'it' represents the `CommandSource` that executed the command.
                // Why are there brackets around the component? For some reason Mojang decided
                // the message argument in `sendSuccess()` needed to be a supplier, which I think
                // is dumb. The brackets are a way of letting Kotlin know that it's a function that
                // can be called, and in this case it just returns the component. It's like a closure.
                it.source.sendSuccess({ Component.literal("Sent 1000 circuits to their location(s).") }, true)

                // the return value of the command, see the `/return` command on the Minecraft wiki
                // if you're unsure, just leave it as `0`
                0
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Groups

The framework also allows you to create groups of commands, so you don't have to repeatedly
type the same prefix when making them.

```kt title="MyCommands.kt" ins={14-17,60} mark={18-59}
package com.example.mymod.commands

// ...
import net.minecraft.commands.arguments.EntityArgument
import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.api.ext.EntityTypeExt.trySpawnOneThousand
import dev.wendigodrip.thebrokenscript.registry.TBSEntities
import net.minecraft.network.chat.Component

@EventBusSubscriber
object MyCommands {
    @SubscribeEvent
    fun register(event: RegisterCommandsEvent) {
        CommandDSL(event.dispatcher) {
            // All commands in this group will start with `/funny`.
            // If all commands in this group should require permission level 4,
            // you could do `group("funny", 4)` instead.
            group("funny") {
                // This would be `/funny send [players]`, so
                // `/funny send @s` or `/funny send SomePlayer` or even `/funny send @a[tag=do_the_funny]` would work.
                add("send [players]", EntityArgument.players()) {
                    // Get the argument
                    val players = EntityArgument.getPlayers(it, "players")

                    // Go through every player the selector ('players') matched
                    for (player in players) {
                        // Spawn 1000 circuits at the player's location.
                        // `trySpawnOneThousand` is an extension function from TBS's `EntityTypeExt` object.
                        TBSEntities.CIRCUIT.get().trySpawnOneThousand(player.level(), player.position())
                    }

                    // 'it' represents the `CommandSource` that executed the command.
                    // Why are there brackets around the component? For some reason Mojang decided
                    // the message argument in `sendSuccess()` needed to be a supplier, which I think
                    // is dumb. The brackets are a way of letting Kotlin know that it's a function that
                    // can be called, and in this case it just returns the component. It's like a closure.
                    it.source.sendSuccess({ Component.literal("Sent 1000 circuits to their location(s).") }, true)

                    // the return value of the command, see the `/return` command on the Minecraft wiki
                    // if you're unsure, just leave it as `0`
                    0
                }

                // This would be `/funny me`.
                add("me") {
                    // Spawn 1000 circuits at the sender's location.
                    // `trySpawnOneThousand` is an extension function from TBS's `EntityTypeExt` object.
                    TBSEntities.CIRCUIT.get().trySpawnOneThousand(it.source.level, it.source.position)

                    // 'it' represents the `CommandSource` that executed the command.
                    // Why are there brackets around the component? For some reason Mojang decided
                    // the message argument in `sendSuccess()` needed to be a supplier, which I think
                    // is dumb. The brackets are a way of letting Kotlin know that it's a function that
                    // can be called, and in this case it just returns the component. It's like a closure.
                    it.source.sendSuccess({ Component.literal("Sent 1000 circuits to your location.") }, true)

                    // the return value of the command, see the `/return` command on the Minecraft wiki
                    // if you're unsure, just leave it as `0`
                    0
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
